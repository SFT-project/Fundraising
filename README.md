# Fundraising

Fundraising is a reusable fundraising contract that supports multiple currencies. The project initiators can start a fundraising campaign by simply specifying the desired currency, quantity, duration of the campaign, lock-up period for the fundraising assets, and the interest rate paid to users. Users can choose to participate in suitable fundraising campaigns by pledging their idle assets to the Fundraising contract, earning substantial returns. Once the lock-up period for the assets expires, users can retrieve their assets and receive the corresponding profits.
